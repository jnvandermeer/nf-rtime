* How to we handle trigger in get_data?
  * Timestamp in ms since start
  * Timestamp in #sample within this block
* is it better to store the trigger as a separate channel or as a list of
  (timestamps, event)?  Write data to file
    * pro as-channel:
        *
    * con:
        * does not allow for saving two or more events at the same time
        * inefficient storing
        * inefficient searching for triggers on long recordings
        * events have to be from the same type as the rest of the data
* Write data to file
* Port to Python 3
* Think about how to receive triggers
    * maybe as decorators (not Python-decorators):

        >>> amp = SomeAmp()
        >>> amp = TcpTriggerDecorator(amp)

* add get_channels to GTecAmp
* add get_channels to Epoc
* maybe add a classmethod to the amp base class .from_config(cls, configstr)
  which returns an amplifier which is already configured
