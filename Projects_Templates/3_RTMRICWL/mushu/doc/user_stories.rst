Alice the researcher.
---------------------

Alice wants to use the signal acquisition mainly in a non-interactive way in
Python scripts. She will decide per project what kind of amplifier she needs
and stick with that throughout the experiment.

It is very important that the data is recorded to a file to allow for later
off-line analysis.

Some amplifiers will support their own trigger input others don't. Triggers
are always required for Alice.
