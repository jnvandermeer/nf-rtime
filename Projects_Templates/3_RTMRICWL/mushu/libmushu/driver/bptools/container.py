I'd like to make a container class. The container should just be based on
a numpy array.

The Container is EEG data - so there should be some header info as well as
data info

It should have some methods to allow for communication (Possibly using
multithreading cues)

It should have some automated methods, called whenever something happens

For now... it should just accept stuff from a Process
The Process will be called 'ReadInputStream', and it should read BVA amp.


This is a very special type of container, in that the most recent data points..
ALWAYS come first!
it also monitors block.. and if it's something other than from memory..
it'll fix it.


This is the fast implementation of the Container class.
